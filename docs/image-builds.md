# KIWI image builds and SourceForge releases

The Lyra image pipeline has four explicit boundaries:

- GitHub is the canonical source for the KIWI description and root overlay;
- KIWI builds run locally or in CI from a clean Git commit;
- SourceForge is the public distribution point for ISO artifacts;
- OBS builds and publishes RPM packages only.

There is no OBS image project, KIWI package, image repository, or ISO binary.
The image tool deliberately has no command capable of creating one.
`kiwi/config.xml` owns the installed repositories and package selection,
`release.toml` owns the release identity, and `image-build.toml` records this
distribution policy plus the OBS projects used only as RPM sources.

## Policy gate and deterministic source export

Run the release and repository checks, then create an inspectable source
export from a clean commit:

```sh
./scripts/release.py check
./scripts/obs-release.py validate
./scripts/image-build.py validate
destination="$(mktemp -d)/lyra-image"
./scripts/image-build.py export "$destination"
./scripts/image-build.py verify-export "$destination"
```

`--allow-dirty` exists only for structural inspection. A dirty export records
that state and cannot pass `verify-export`.

The export contains the canonical `config.xml`, `config.sh`, final
`edit_boot_config.sh` hook, pinned RPM signing keyring, root overlay, and a
normalized `root.tar.gz`. The hook runs after KIWI has generated the live
bootloader files and keeps the
installed rootfs theme path under `/usr/share/grub/themes` without changing
the ISO's separate `/boot/grub2/themes` layout. The export also records the full Git commit, commit
epoch, and deterministic UTC build timestamp in `build-source.json` and
`root/usr/lib/lyra-os/build-source`. The latter becomes
`/usr/lib/lyra-os/build-info` in the installed system.

The verification gate rejects an export that differs from the GitHub KIWI
description, contains `_multibuild` or an `obsrepositories:/` source, uses a
staging repository, disables repository/package signature checks, or lacks
the embedded source identity.

## Build and test the ISO

For an interactive development build with the current installer workspace,
VM installation, and first-boot test, use:

```sh
./kiwi/test/build-and-run-vm.sh
```

The helper compiles the local Rust installer before KIWI and records
`local-installer-build` in that development image. A release candidate must
instead consume the signed installer RPM published by OBS:

```sh
./kiwi/test/build-and-run-vm.sh --published-installer
```

Build and validate that candidate without requiring QEMU, KVM, OVMF, a
graphical session, or replacing an existing test VM:

```sh
./kiwi/test/build-and-run-vm.sh --build-only --published-installer
```

The script builds directly from `kiwi/`, retains the previous usable ISO until
its replacement is ready, and records logs below `kiwi/.kiwi/`. A VM run then
creates a 24 GiB installation disk plus isolated OVMF state and starts QEMU.
The previous QEMU process, disk and NVRAM are replaced only after the new ISO
has passed validation; `--build-only` never touches them. The ISO is selected
only for the first boot; reboot the guest in the same QEMU session to test the
installed disk. `--help` lists the environment overrides for disk, RAM and
virtual CPUs. CI uses the deterministic export gate to prove that the same
committed inputs are selected without publishing an image to OBS.

After logging into the installed account, generate the first-boot evidence:

```sh
sudo -v
lyra-system-smoke first-boot --output first-boot-result.json
```

The collector remains a regular-user process so the evidence records the
installed account. It uses the cached sudo credential only for noninteractive,
read-only access to GRUB, Snapper and the system journal; missing authorization
is emitted as a failed structured check rather than a traceback.

For a run created with `--secure-boot`, record the separate firmware and EFI
evidence as well:

```sh
lyra-system-smoke secure-boot --output uefi-secure-boot-result.json
```

Both commands fail closed. The first-boot check rejects a remaining live user,
autologin, installer RPM, privileged installer service/polkit rule, invalid
`fstab`, non-Btrfs root, missing EFI mount, unavailable Snapper, failed system
units or an unreviewed critical journal entry. The Secure Boot check requires
an EFI boot, mounted ESP, enabled firmware state and fallback loader.

Signature verification is mandatory through `rpm-check-signatures`,
`repository_gpgcheck`, and `package_gpgcheck`. The KIWI description uses the
canonical HTTPS openSUSE and Lyra package repositories. Flathub's URL and
signing key are versioned at
`kiwi/root/etc/flatpak/remotes.d/flathub.flatpakrepo`; no network command runs
from `config.sh`. The build helper passes the reviewed
`kiwi/keys/obs-package-signing-keyring.asc` through KIWI's `--signing-key`
option before package preload; a missing key or fingerprint drift fails the
local image policy gate instead of disabling signature verification.

The dedicated NVIDIA ISO was canceled. Lyra ships one Desktop ISO; the
optional proprietary driver flow runs post-install through Vega with hardware
detection, confirmation, a Snapper snapshot, validation and rollback.

## Release evidence

Keep the ISO together with its package inventory, verification report, KIWI
report, checksum and both SBOM formats. A detached checksum signature becomes
mandatory starting with Beta 1 (ADR 0005); Alpha 4 is an unsigned pre-Beta
exception:

- `*.iso`
- `*.packages`
- `*.verified`
- `*.report`
- `*.iso.sha256`
- `*.iso.sha256.asc` (Beta 1 and later)
- `*.cdx.json`
- `*.spdx.json`

The `.packages` file records exact RPM versions and OBS source revisions.
Before the KIWI build, create the signed public-repository health report:

```sh
./scripts/obs-release.py health \
  --output /path/to/obs-health-2026.08-alpha4.json
```

When installation finishes successfully, the frontend writes
`~/lyra-installer-result.json` in the live session. Copy it together with the
other evidence before rebooting; it is not transferred to the installed
account.

Create a checksummed evidence document and link the OBS health, installer and
smoke-test results:

```sh
./scripts/image-build.py artifact-manifest /path/to/kiwi/results \
  --output /path/to/lyra-os.evidence.json \
  --test-result obs-repositories=/path/to/obs-health-2026.08-alpha4.json \
  --test-result live-session=/path/to/live-session-result.json \
  --test-result installer=/path/to/lyra-installer-result.json \
  --test-result first-boot=/path/to/first-boot-result.json \
  --test-result uefi-secure-boot=/path/to/uefi-secure-boot-result.json \
  --test-result rollback=/path/to/rollback-result.json \
  --test-result hardware-matrix=/path/to/hardware-matrix-result.json
```

Every result is schema-1 JSON with top-level `"status": "passed"` and the
structure required for its role. A bare green status is not evidence. The
command fails if the source tree is dirty, an artifact is absent or ambiguous,
the package inventory does not contain exact sources, required evidence is
missing, a result has the wrong mode/checks, rollback has not reached its final
verified phase, or the hardware matrix names a different ISO. The full decision
policy and publication checklist are in [`release-gate.md`](release-gate.md).

After the checksum and release gates pass, publish the ISO and its evidence on
SourceForge. Upload credentials and the SourceForge release operation remain
outside this repository; this prevents CI or an OBS package workflow from
silently distributing an unapproved image.

Treat the tested ISO as immutable. Immediately after its gates pass, run the
release builder with `--artifacts-only` against that same work directory and
upload the resulting bundle before starting another image change. Never rebuild
an approved ISO only to create publication metadata: a rebuild changes the
candidate checksum and invalidates the ISO-bound evidence. If preparation or
upload fails, preserve the tested ISO and resume from its existing work
directory.

## OBS boundary

OBS remains responsible for the Lyra, Vega, Fina, and installer RPMs. Their
staging, health, signing, and promotion are controlled by
`scripts/obs-release.py` and documented in `docs/obs-release.md`.

Do not add an image project, `Type: kiwi` project configuration, `_multibuild`
image recipe, or ISO publication step to OBS. Any future image automation must
consume the GitHub sources and hand approved artifacts to the SourceForge
release process without storing the ISO in OBS.
