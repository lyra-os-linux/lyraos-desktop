# %%check parses every shipped snippet with fish --no-execute.
BuildRequires:  fish

# fish is the default shell of the Lyra OS desktop account; this package is
# the productivity layer on top of it. fzf backs PatrickF1/fzf.fish, and
# curl fetches Fisher, which upstream does not ship as an RPM.
Requires:       fish >= 3.4
Requires:       fzf
Requires:       curl
Requires:       git

# nvm-fish ships the same function names in the vendor directories. Both can
# coexist: ~/.config/fish precedes them in $fish_function_path, so the Fisher
# copy wins for accounts that ran the setup and the packaged one remains the
# fallback for every other account. Recommends, not Requires: the pack is
# useful without it.
Recommends:     nvm-fish

%description
Fisher plus the fish plugin set validated for Lyra OS: fzf.fish, z,
autopair.fish, done, hydro, bass, plugin-git and nvm.fish.

The plugin set is installed per account under ~/.config/fish. On a Lyra OS
image the setup runs at build time and is seeded through /etc/skel, so a new
installation has everything on its first terminal, with no network access.
On any other account the fish_setup_lyra_plugins function installs the same
set on demand, and lyra_fish_status reports what is installed and active.

%build
# The functions report the packaged version so that an update which changes
# the canonical plugin list triggers exactly one re-run per account.
